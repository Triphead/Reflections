New reflections for lesson 2.




How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
The staging area is a medium step between the working directory that you're currently opperating in, and the commit. 


What value do you think it offers?

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
By comparing the staged changes to the latest commit.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
When working with experimental changes or changes that may not necesarily want to keep in the future. Branches would create a way of making these changes while leaving the main project unchanged.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
By allowing you to see the whole tree including which commits are linked with which other commmits, and which commits are unreachable as they're currently not on a branch. Viewing a diagram like this allows us to easily see which changes have been made and where we can find them by accessing the correct branches.
